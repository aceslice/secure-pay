# SecurePay

SecurePay is a Node.js application for processing payments using Paystack and MongoDB. It provides a secure backend for handling payment transactions, with JWT authentication and data storage in a MongoDB database.

## Features

- Secure payment processing using Paystack API
- JWT authentication for protecting endpoints
- MongoDB integration for storing payment data
- Environment variable configuration using `dotenv`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kindrew/secure-pay.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and provide values for the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=your_paystack_secret_key
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

## Usage

1. Make payment: Send a POST request to `/api/pay` endpoint with the required parameters (`email`, `amount`, `reason`) to initiate a payment transaction. You need to include a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header for authentication.

2. Receive payment webhook: Set up a webhook endpoint to receive payment notifications from Paystack. Configure this endpoint in your Paystack dashboard.
